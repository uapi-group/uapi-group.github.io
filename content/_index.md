# The Linux Userspace API (UAPI) Group

The userspace API ("uapi") group is a community for people with an interest in innovating how we build, deploy, run, and securely update modern Linux operating systems.
It serves as a central gathering place for specs, documentation, and ideas.

The group is in the process of constituting itself and is exploring the problem space.
In the general scope of the group are trusted boot mechanisms, kernel / disk image formats, TPM usage, safe and secure updates, and related topics.
The group also cares about interop of image-based and/or immutable Linux distributions.
The group is in its inception, so the list of topics is by no means complete.
Other relevant topics related to the above might be added in the future.

The UAPI group aims to establish specifications for common concepts shared among relevant parties.
We are open to anyone who has an interest in constructive collaboration to join the discussions, and to represent the directions and interests of their projects and distributions.

Contributing members include people from Ubuntu Core, Debian, GNOME OS, Fedora CoreOS, Endless OS, Arch Linux, SUSE, Flatcar, 
systemd, image-builder/osbuild, mkosi, tpm2-software, System Transparency, buildstream, BTRFS, bootc, composefs, (rpm-)ostree,
Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta.
